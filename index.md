# Dhanvi Desu
## Welcome to my *User Page*
##### I hope you are ***excited*** to learn about me!

My favorite type of food is cake. As Marie-Antoinette said:
> Let them eat cake.

My favorite commands are:
```
System.out.println();
Sysyem.err.println();
```
My favorite git commands are:
```
git checkout -b treebranch
git push origin master #just kidding
```

To learn even more about me (not that there is much left to learn), you can visit my [personal portfolio](https://dhanvidesu.herokuapp.com/)
